Getting started
===============

Investment research is a very broad field, and there are many different ways to approach it.  
This project is intended to be a starting point for your own research, and to provide a framework for you to build on.  
It is not intended to be a complete solution, and it is not intended to be a black box that you can blindly trust.  

The project is written in Python, and uses the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library for data analysis.

The project is structured as follows:

* `data` - contains the data files used by the project
* `lib` - contains the source code for the project
* `notebooks` - contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the project
* `tests` - contains unit tests for the project

The project is designed to be used with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), which is a web-based interactive development environment for Python.


Installation
============
The project requires Python 3.5 or later.
