Terms and formula
========================


Four-factor model:
-------------------
    - A mathematical formula to forecast expected returns based on the size, beta, valuation, and momentum of component assets in a portfolio

Three-factor model 
-------------------
    - A mathematical formula to forecast expected returns based on the size, beta, and valua- tion of component assets in a portfolio

Expected risk 
-------------------
    - Projected standard deviation or variance of a portfolio or asset generally based on historical returns often with monthly or daily frequency

Expected return 
-------------------
    - Projected rate of return, usually calculated based on either historical returns or scenario analysis

Weights/allocations 
-------------------
    - Percentage of a portfolio by dollars invested held in various assets within the portfolio

variance 
-------------------
    - Statistical measure of risk computed by taking the returns of a portfolio or asset in each period minus the arithmetic mean return, divided by the number of periods less 1: ((Rp – E(Rp))/n-1), basis for var.s() formula in Excel

Arithmetic mean 
-------------------
    - The value of a set of numbers that can be expected in a normal situation, for example, the return in a given month that can be expected based on past months’ returns, generally calculated as the sum of all past returns divided by number of returns: sum(Rp)/Count(Rp), basis for average() formula in Excel

geometric mean 
-------------------
    - The rate of growth in a number that occurs on average over time; for example, a rate of re- turn that is equal for all months over a year for a buy and hold investment: ((1+Rp)^n ) – 1, basis for geomean() formula in Excel

Standard deviation 
-------------------
    - statistical measure of risk in a portfolio or asset, usually based on historical returns; basis for stdev.s() formula in Excel

Sharpe ratio 
-------------------
    - Measure of relative performance success of a portfolio based on past returns after taking into account the risk-free rate; calculated as (Rp-Rf)/Sigma(Rp)

Sortino ratio 
-------------------
    - measure of relative performance success of a portfolio based on past returns after taking into account the minimum acceptable rate (MAR) of the investor demand; calculated as (Rp-MAR)/Sigma(Rp)

Information ratio 
-------------------
    - Measure of relative performance success of a portfolio based on past returns after taking into account the market rate of return; calculated as (Rp-Rm)/Sigma(Rp)

Treynor measure 
-------------------
    - Measure of relative performance success of a portfolio based on past returns after taking into account the risk in the portfolio as defined by beta; calculated as (Rp-Rf)/beta of portfolio)

Beta 
-------------------
    - Measure of the degree of covariance between an asset and the market; usually calculated as the re- gression coefficient of an asset’s returns against the market

VAR 
-------------------
    - value at risk is a common metric for measuring risk in a broader portfolio; loosely defined as the worst losses that might be expected under a normal set of market conditions, and formally defined as the 5% or 1% percentile of returns in a broad set of historical returns for the portfolio. which can be calculated by using the percentile.inc() formula in Excel
